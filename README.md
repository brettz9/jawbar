# JawBar

A JavaScript implementation of Firefox's "Awesome Bar".

HTML5's `<datalist>` element, while a step up from nothing, does not
allow to user input to vary from what gets shown in the drop-down.
I thought the original project by Lewis Linn White Jr. was quite a
good start and I hope more features can be added (see below).

# Installation

1. For the styles (currently non-existent, but I plan to move them from
out of the JavaScript), add this:
    `<link href="styles/demo.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />`
1. Add this for JavaScript:
    `<script src="../src/jawbar.js"></script>`


# Todos

1. Change code to use stylesheet (and query if necessary)
1. Add support for key commands like up-down arrows and escape (or blur event) to collapse
